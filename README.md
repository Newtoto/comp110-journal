<h2>When does a physical system compute?</h2>

Establishing a consensus for a definition for anything can be a tricky thing, especially when you get into depth and realise your definition excludes something which your gut reaction would consider to be included. Computation is very much on the upper end of contestability due to it being both a more modern concept and a very complex topic. This paper's central conclusion of "physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution" essentially means that for a physical system to be computing, it must be taking an abstract of an object, such as the wave equation for an electron, and forming that object and making predictions of how it will interact. I find this conclusion to be satisfactory since it covers both computers in the conventional PC sense, and also in the biological sense since our brains are taking an abstract input of the objects around us and forming them into what we sense. It is because of computation and physics that we are able to break down these objects into the abstract and have other systems form their own physical representation with a different moddeling relation, saving us from having to replicate how our brains compute. This allows us to have more powerful computers than our brains model scenarios with their own physical representation and then, once again, form the abstract for us to be able to interpret.

<h2>Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming</h2>

The experiements within this paper more or less all state that there is no significant difference in performance when using a flow chart, whether this be in program composition, comprehension or debugging. An improvement was seen in experiment 3, in which the use of a flow chart for debugging and comprehension did seem to help those who had previous experience with them. However, this difference was no more than 10% and in a sample size of 70, this could be put down to chance. This paperis more of an initial step into contesting the benefits of flowcharts due to the sample sizes not being large enough to yield confident conclusions.
