<h2>When does a physical system compute?</h2>

Establishing a consensus for a definition for anything can be a tricky thing, especially when you get into depth and realise your definition excludes something which your gut reaction would consider to be included. Computation is very much on the upper end of contestability due to it being both a more modern concept and a very complex topic. This paper's central conclusion of "physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution" essentially means that for a physical system to be computing, it must be taking an abstract of an object, such as the wave equation for an electron, and forming that object and making predictions of how it will interact. I find this conclusion to be satisfactory since it covers both computers in the conventional PC sense, and also in the biological sense since our brains are taking an abstract input of the objects around us and forming them into what we sense. It is because of computation and physics that we are able to break down these objects into the abstract and have other systems form their own physical representation with a different moddeling relation, saving us from having to replicate how our brains compute. This allows us to have more powerful computers than our brains model scenarios with their own physical representation and then, once again, form the abstract for us to be able to interpret.

<h2>Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming</h2>

The experiements within this paper more or less all state that there is no significant difference in performance when using a flow chart, whether this be in program composition, comprehension or debugging. An improvement was seen in experiment 3, in which the use of a flow chart for debugging and comprehension did seem to help those who had previous experience with them. However, this difference was no more than 10% and in a sample size of 70, this could be put down to chance. This paper is more of an initial step into contesting the benefits of flowcharts, because the sample sizes not being large enough to yield confident conclusions.

<h2>A Fast Procedure for Computing in the Distance Between Complex Objects in Three-Dimensional Space</h2>

This paper gives a faster process for calculating the shortest line segment for 2 objects (Euclidean distance) in 3D space. The application of which apply wherever 3D worlds and computers combine such as robotics, physics modelling and 3D computer games. I don't understand the maths, but if this paper is to believed, it gives a more efficient method for getting the Euclidean distance than earlier used methods. Since the abstract physics is required to allow for a computer to work out this distance, as opposed to a person interacting with the physical world where this distance seems instinctive, the maths involved gets quite heavy. 

<h2>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</h2>

Dijkstra starts off by suggesting that go to statements should be abolished for languages any higher than machine code, however he himself mentions that it is the unbridled use of the go to statement which has negative consequences. Abolishing any available toolkit and branding all use of it as "harmful" seems counter intuitive since it does offer functionality. The title just feels like he was going to shock and get interest since proper use of any statement can make code more efficient and legible.

Keeping the code as chronological as possible as Dijkstra suggests seems nice, but practically writing code like this is inneficient since things would have to be repeated. Although it's easy to follow, this doesn't lend its self to being easy to edit because to change a variable or a section of code you may have to trek through the code editing multiple. It's far quicker being able to refer back to an individual section of code with something like a go to statement and editing it once to change all uses of that code.

<h2>Links between the papers</h2>

The link I have found between these papers is that of abstract to physical. A computer computes when it takes an abstract and makes it physical and a flow chart is an abstract of a process which is then made physical. Calculating the Euclidean distance is done by breaking down the physical into abstract maths and physics equations, and Dijkstra tries to reduce the usage of the go to statement to make the abstract code process closer to the physical running of the code for ease of understanding.
